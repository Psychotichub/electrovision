# ⚡ Training AI Models from DWG/PDF Electrical Plans

This guide shows you how to train your AI model directly from your **DWG and PDF electrical plan files**.

## 🎯 Overview

Instead of synthetic data, we'll use your **real electrical plans** to train the AI:
- **PDF files** → Extract high-quality images from each page
- **DWG files** → Convert to DXF → Generate technical drawings
- **DXF files** → Create clean line drawings for training

## 📁 Step 1: Organize Your Files

Create this folder structure and place your files:

```
ai_model/
├── source_files/
│   ├── pdf/        ← Put your PDF electrical plans here
│   ├── dwg/        ← Put your DWG files here
│   └── dxf/        ← Put your DXF files here
├── dataset/        ← Training images will go here (auto-created)
└── extracted_images/  ← Raw extracted images (auto-created)
```

### Example File Organization:
```
source_files/
├── pdf/
│   ├── warehouse_electrical_plan.pdf
│   ├── office_building_layout.pdf
│   └── residential_wiring.pdf
├── dwg/
│   ├── industrial_panel_layout.dwg
│   └── control_room_schematic.dwg
└── dxf/
    └── power_distribution.dxf
```

## 🔧 Step 2: Install Required Dependencies

First, install the extra dependencies needed for file conversion:

```bash
pip install matplotlib PyMuPDF ezdxf
```

## 🚀 Step 3: Convert Files to Training Images

Run the conversion script:

```bash
# Convert all files in source_files/ directory
python prepare_training_data.py

# Or specify custom directories
python prepare_training_data.py --source my_electrical_plans --output my_training_images
```

### What this does:
1. **📄 PDF Processing**: Extracts each page as a high-quality image (300 DPI)
2. **📐 DWG Processing**: Converts to DXF then renders as technical drawings
3. **📋 DXF Processing**: Creates clean line drawings showing all electrical components
4. **📁 Organization**: Automatically splits into train/validation sets (80%/20%)

## 📊 Step 4: Expected Output

After running the script, you'll see:

============================================================

✅ Created directory structure

🔍 Scanning for electrical plan files in: source_files
📄 Found 3 PDF files
📐 Found 2 DWG files
📋 Found 1 DXF files

📄 Processing 3 PDF files...
📄 Processing PDF: source_files/pdf/warehouse_electrical_plan.pdf
  ✅ Extracted page 1 → extracted_images/pdf_warehouse_electrical_plan_page_001.jpg
  ✅ Extracted page 2 → extracted_images/pdf_warehouse_electrical_plan_page_002.jpg

📁 Organizing 8 images for training...
✅ Training set: 6 images
✅ Validation set: 2 images

🎯 Training Data Summary:
   Total images extracted: 8
   Training images: 6
   Validation images: 2
```

## 🏷️ Step 5: Annotate Your Images

Now you need to label the electrical components in your images:

### Install LabelImg:
```bash
pip install labelImg
```

### Start Annotation:
```bash
# Annotate training images
labelImg dataset/images/train dataset/labels/train

# When done with training, annotate validation images
labelImg dataset/images/val dataset/labels/val
```

### Label the 9 Component Classes:
- **0: switch** - Light switches, toggle switches, control switches
- **1: outlet** - Electrical outlets, receptacles, GFCI outlets
- **2: light** - Light fixtures, ceiling lights, lamps, LED panels
- **3: panel** - Electrical panels, distribution boards, control panels
- **4: wire** - Electrical wires, cables, conduits, wire runs
- **5: junction** - Wire junctions, connection points, splice boxes
- **6: breaker** - Circuit breakers, fuses, protection devices
- **7: ground** - Ground symbols, earth connections, bonding
- **8: measurement** - Voltage readings, amperage, meter symbols

### Annotation Tips:
- Draw tight bounding boxes around each component
- Include component labels/text if visible
- Label partially visible components
- Skip unclear or ambiguous items
- Save frequently (Ctrl+S)

## 🎯 Step 6: Train Your Model

Once you have annotated at least 20-30 images, start training:

```bash
python train.py
```

The model will train on your real electrical plans and learn to recognize:
- **Your specific drawing style**
- **Your component symbols**
- **Your annotation standards**
- **Your typical layouts**

## 🔄 Step 7: Iterate and Improve

### Add More Files:
1. Add new PDF/DWG files to `source_files/`
2. Run `python prepare_training_data.py` again
3. Annotate the new images
4. Retrain the model

### Improve Accuracy:
- **More data**: 50+ images for good results, 200+ for excellent
- **Better annotations**: Consistent, accurate bounding boxes
- **Diverse plans**: Different building types, scales, styles
- **Quality images**: Clear, high-resolution electrical plans

## 📋 File Format Support

### PDF Files:
- ✅ Multi-page electrical plans
- ✅ Scanned documents (converted to images)
- ✅ Vector-based drawings
- ✅ Mixed content (text + diagrams)

### DWG Files:
- ✅ AutoCAD native format
- ⚠️ Requires conversion to DXF first
- 🔧 Install ODA File Converter for best results

### DXF Files:
- ✅ Direct processing
- ✅ Lines, circles, arcs, polylines
- ✅ Text annotations
- ✅ Layer information

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "No files found" Error:
- Check that files are in the correct directories
- Verify file extensions (.pdf, .dwg, .dxf)
- Check file permissions

### DWG Conversion Issues:
- Install ODA File Converter: https://www.opendesign.com/guestfiles/oda_file_converter
- Or use AutoCAD to save as DXF
- Or use LibreCAD for conversion

### Poor Image Quality:
- Increase DPI in the script (change `mat = fitz.Matrix(3.0, 3.0)` to `4.0, 4.0`)
- Use higher quality source files
- Clean up scanned documents before processing

## 🎉 Success Metrics

With good training data from your electrical plans:
- **Accuracy**: 90-95% detection rate
- **Speed**: 2-5 seconds per image analysis
- **Reliability**: Consistent results across similar drawing styles
- **Adaptability**: Works with your specific symbols and layouts

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Start Small**: Use 5-10 plans for initial testing
2. **Annotate Carefully**: Quality over quantity for first batch
3. **Test Early**: Train with 20-30 images to verify the approach
4. **Scale Up**: Add more plans as you see good results
5. **Iterate**: Continuously improve with more data and better annotations
